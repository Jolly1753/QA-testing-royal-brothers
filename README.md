This project is an end-to-end automation framework built to automate the booking flow of the Royal Brothers website using Playwright with Java, Maven, and Cucumber (BDD).
The automation covers city selection, booking date and time, applying filters, validating results, and collecting bike availability data as part of the assignment requirements.
